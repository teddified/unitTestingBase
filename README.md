This project is running with Jest and Enzyme to test React components and business logic.

## What is in here?

Right now there is just one component which multiplies 2 input fields on a button click event.
With this basic setup we can check rather the component has <b>properties</b> or not. In this case we have a placeholder for the result field. Additionally we want to check business logic which we can verify with setting up values for the multiplication and check if the result is correct.

## Getting Started

\$ `npm install`
\$ `npm test`
